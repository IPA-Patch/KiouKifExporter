Kiou Kif Exporter is the simplest possible kifu pipeline for **KIOU**: the
moment a match ends, the tweak calls the app's own internal KIF writer and
drops the resulting `.kif` file into the app's `Documents/KiouKifExporter/`
folder. Files.app picks it up, AirDrop ships it to the desktop, and any
kifu viewer that understands the standard KIF 2.0 format can replay it
without one byte of pre-processing.

There is no host-side bridge, no WebSocket server, no proxy. The entire
flow lives in one ~110 KB dylib that hooks five lifecycle methods and
writes a single file per match.

### Observation-only

Kiou Kif Exporter is strictly **read-then-write**. During a match the
tweak's hooks observe `IMatchMode.InitializeAsync` and
`IMatchMode.OnPlayerMoveAsync` to keep a live `GameController*` pointer
in hand; when `IMatchMode.OnMatchEndAsync` fires, the tweak asks KIOU's
own `KIFWriter.Write` for the finished kifu and writes the resulting
string to disk. That's all.

The tweak never:

- writes back into `GameController`, `RecordManager`, or any other
  in-memory game state,
- alters which side wins, the move list, the result reason, or the
  on-screen replay,
- opens a socket, talks to the KIOU backend, or sits on the network
  path in any form.

The only piece of state Kiou Kif Exporter creates is a single `.kif`
file per match, inside the app's own sandbox at
`Documents/KiouKifExporter/`. Uninstalling the dylib returns KIOU to a
fully vanilla state and leaves your existing `.kif` files alone until
you delete them yourself.

## What you get

For every match you play — VsAI, CPU Stream, Online PvP, Local PvP, or
even Record Replay — a file lands at:

```
<KIOU sandbox>/Documents/KiouKifExporter/{ISO8601_UTC}_{mode}_{startpos}.kif
```

Example file name:

```
20260615T004046_CPUStreamMode_startpos.kif
```

Where:

| Segment | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ISO8601_UTC` | UTC timestamp, `yyyyMMdd'T'HHmmss` — filename-safe, sorts lexicographically. |
| `mode` | One of `AIMatchMode`, `CPUStreamMode`, `OnlinePvPMode`, `LocalPvPMode`, `RecordReplayMode`. |
| `startpos` | `startpos` for a standard initial position, otherwise `sfen-<8 hex>` (SHA-1 prefix of the starting SFEN — handicaps, custom positions, etc). |

The file itself is the canonical KIF 2.0 format produced by KIOU's own
internal `KIFWriter.Write`. Concretely:

```text
# ----  KIF形式  ----
手合割：平手
手数----指手---------消費時間--
   1 ２六歩(27)
   2 ２四歩(23)
   3 ２五歩(26)
   ...
  19 同　竜(21)
  20 ７二玉(71)
  21 ６二銀打
```

Every desktop and iOS kifu viewer that reads `.kif` reads this — verified
against PiyoShogi (iOS) and Kifu for Windows on a standard install. No
re-encoding, no charset conversion: UTF-8 in, UTF-8 out.

### What the KIF header carries

`KIFWriteOptions` is populated at match end with metadata pulled from
the live `MatchConfig`, `GameStateStore` and `GameController`. Every
desktop and iOS viewer that reads `.kif` honors these rows.

| Header | Source |
|---|---|
| `先手：<name>` / `後手：<name>` | `GameStateStore._blackPlayerInfo` / `_whitePlayerInfo` (`ReactiveProperty<PlayerInfo>` at +0x50 / +0x58 → currentValue at +0x20 → `Name`), with a fallback to `MatchConfig.<Black|White>Player.Name` for AI / local / replay modes. |
| `開始日時：YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS` | Wall-clock `NSDate` captured at `InitializeAsync`, packed into a `Nullable<DateTime>` tick value at the match-end fill. |
| `棋戦：<title>` | Synthesized as `"{mode} @ {iso8601}"` (e.g. `OnlinePvPMode @ 20260615T193557`) via `il2cpp_string_new`. |
| `持ち時間：<label>` | `kif_build_time_rule_label` from `MatchConfig.TimeControl` (e.g. `1500秒+秒読み60秒`). |
| `まで○○手で<reason>` ending label | `kif_winreason_label(GameController.<Reason>k__BackingField)` mapped to `投了` / `詰み` / `時間切れ` / `千日手` etc. |

The one slot still intentionally NULL is **per-move consumption times**
(`KIFWriteOptions.ThinkingTimesMicros`). The KIF body is still valid
without it; only the `(M:SS/HH:MM:SS)` annotation is absent. This is
queued for v0.3 — see [Roadmap](#roadmap).

Full implementation map — including each setter RVA, the field offsets,
and the il2cpp string / List bridging plan — lives in
[`docs/plans/kiou_kif_exporter.md`](../../../docs/plans/kiou_kif_exporter.md)
in the repository root.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    init["IMatchMode.InitializeAsync"]
    opm["IMatchMode.OnPlayerMoveAsync"]
    endHook["IMatchMode.OnMatchEndAsync"]
    cache(["g_gameCtrlCache &middot; GameController*"])

    init -- "latch from adapter arg" --> cache
    opm  -- "refresh (backup latch)"  --> cache

    endHook --> writer["kif_writer_emit_for_match_end()"]
    cache  --> writer

    writer --> usiText["GameController.GetUSIText"]
    usiText --> usiStr(["position startpos moves &hellip;"])
    usiStr --> parse["USIParser.ParseUSI(string)"]
    parse --> record(["RecordManager*"])

    record --> kifwrite["KIFWriter.Write(record, opts)"]
    opts(["KIFWriteOptions* &middot; 0x60 raw NSMutableData<br/>+ .ctor() &mdash; all fields null"]) --> kifwrite

    kifwrite --> kif(["KIF 2.0 string"])

    kif --> file[("&lt;sandbox&gt;/Documents/KiouKifExporter/<br/>{ISO8601}_{mode}_{startpos}.kif")]
    file --> files["Files.app"]
    files --> sinks["AirDrop &middot; PiyoShogi &middot; Shogi Browser Q &middot; iCloud Drive"]
```

Five concrete `IMatchMode` implementations are hooked, three lifecycle
methods each — fifteen `MSHookFunction` / `DobbyHook` installs in total:

| Hook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `InitializeAsync` | Latch `GameController` from the `ShogiGameAdapter` argument. |
| `OnPlayerMoveAsync` | Backup latch in case `InitializeAsync` handed us a NULL adapter. |
| `OnMatchEndAsync` | Run the KIF pipeline and write the file — **before chaining to the original**, while the GameController is still alive. |

The write is synchronous and blocks the OnMatchEndAsync handler for the
duration of a single `KIFWriter.Write` call (typically sub-millisecond).
After the file lands, the original `OnMatchEndAsync` runs as usual and
KIOU teardown proceeds.

## Install

Pick the row that matches how your device is signed.

### Jailbroken (rootless — Dopamine / palera1n)

Easiest path. The dylib ships as a regular `.deb` and is loaded by
`MobileSubstrate` / `ElleKit` on next launch.

1. Download the latest `work.tkgstrator.kioukifexporter_<ver>_iphoneos-arm64.deb`
   from the [Releases page](https://github.com/IPA-Patch/KiouKifExporter/releases).
2. Open the `.deb` in **Sileo** (or **Zebra** / **Cydia**) and install.
3. Respring or relaunch KIOU.
4. To get the saved `.kif` files into Files.app, follow
   [Files-app exposure on jailbreak](#files-app-exposure-on-jailbreak) once.
   You only need to do this the first time the tweak is installed; the
   `Info.plist` change survives KIOU updates as long as the bundle UUID
   doesn't change.

Filza users can already see `.kif` files at
`/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<UUID>/Documents/KiouKifExporter/`
even without that Info.plist tweak.

### TrollStore

Single bundle — patch the IPA's `Info.plist` first so Files.app sees the
sandbox, then inject the dylib and install. TrollStore's permanent
signature covers any modification you make to the bundle on disk, so
the resulting install is stable.

1. Extract a decrypted KIOU IPA to a working directory.
2. Open `Payload/KIOU.app/Info.plist` and add (or, in Plist Editor, tick):
   ```xml
   <key>UIFileSharingEnabled</key>
   <true/>
   <key>LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace</key>
   <true/>
   ```
3. Copy `KiouKifExporter.dylib` into `Payload/KIOU.app/Frameworks/` and
   inject it with [`insert_dylib`](https://github.com/Tyilo/insert_dylib)
   or [`optool`](https://github.com/alexzielenski/optool):
   ```sh
   insert_dylib --weak --inplace --no-strip-codesig \
     '@executable_path/Frameworks/KiouKifExporter.dylib' \
     Payload/KIOU.app/KIOU
   ```
4. Re-zip as `KIOU-KifExporter.ipa` and open it from Files.app on the
   device; TrollStore picks it up.
5. Launch KIOU. The `.kif` folder appears in Files.app under
   **On My iPhone -> KIOU -> KiouKifExporter** once the first match
   finishes.

### Sideloadly / AltStore / Apple Developer Program

Self-signed certificates expire (7 days for a free Apple ID, 1 year for
a paid Developer Program account). Each refresh re-signs the same IPA, so
the inject + plist tweak only has to happen once.

1. Open Sideloadly and drop a decrypted KIOU `.ipa` onto it.
2. Switch to the **Advanced** pane.
3. Tick **Enable File Sharing** — Sideloadly injects
   `UIFileSharingEnabled` and `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` into
   the `Info.plist` for you.
4. Under **Inject dylibs**, click **Add** and pick the
   `KiouKifExporter.dylib` you downloaded from the Releases page (the
   `make jailed` artifact).
5. Sign with your Apple ID and install.

AltStore is identical: drop the IPA into AltStore, then before signing
go into **Settings -> Advanced** and add the dylib + tick file sharing.

> **Note (Sideloadly Free Dev Cert):** the cert restricts the entitlements
> the resulting binary can hold, which in turn limits some runtime hook
> techniques. Kiou Kif Exporter only needs `MobileSubstrate` /
> `ElleKit`-style inline hooks via Dobby; this has been observed to work
> on Free Dev installs, but if a future iOS update tightens the W+X
> enforcement, the v0.4 static-patch build will become the supported
> path for Free Dev users.

## Files app integration

The destination path uses `NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, ...)`,
which resolves to the running app's sandbox `Documents` directory. For
Files.app to expose it, the KIOU bundle needs:

```xml
<key>UIFileSharingEnabled</key>
<true/>
<key>LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace</key>
<true/>
```

These keys are **absent from the retail KIOU `Info.plist`**, so on a stock
install Files.app will not show a KIOU section even though the dylib is
faithfully writing `.kif` files. There are three ways to fix that:

| Distribution | How to enable |
|---|---|
| **Jailbreak (rootless)** | Edit `Info.plist` in-place (see [Files-app exposure on jailbreak](#files-app-exposure-on-jailbreak) below). |
| **TrollStore** | Edit the `Info.plist` inside your locally-extracted `.ipa` before installing, then `TrollStore` accepts the modified bundle outright (CoreTrust exploit covers the Info.plist hash mismatch). |
| **Sideloadly / AltStore / Apple Developer Program** | Check **"Enable File Sharing"** in Sideloadly when sideloading; it injects both keys automatically. |

### Files-app exposure on jailbreak

For development on a jailbroken device, edit the `Info.plist` directly.
**Do not run `ldid -S` against the KIOU Mach-O** — it will strip the
existing code-signature and AMFI will refuse to launch the app.

```sh
# 1. Backup
APP=/var/containers/Bundle/Application/<UUID>/KIOU.app
cp -p $APP/Info.plist $APP/Info.plist.bak

# 2. Patch (on host, in Python)
python3 - <<'PY'
import plistlib
with open('Info.plist','rb') as f:
    pl = plistlib.load(f)
pl['UIFileSharingEnabled'] = True
pl['LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace'] = True
with open('Info.plist','wb') as f:
    plistlib.dump(pl, f, fmt=plistlib.FMT_XML)
PY

# 3. scp back, then re-register and relaunch
scp Info.plist root@<device>:$APP/Info.plist
ssh root@<device> "uicache -p $APP && open com.neconome.shogi"
```

Most jailbreak AMFI bypasses tolerate the `_CodeSignature/CodeResources`
mismatch the edit introduces — there is no need to re-sign anything.

## Compatibility

This build targets:

| | |
|---|---|
| **KIOU app version** | `1.0.1` (`CFBundleVersion` 11) |
| **iOS** | 15.0 – 16.5, arm64, rootless |

All hooks are pinned to RVAs from this exact KIOU build's `UnityFramework`
binary. After a KIOU update the RVAs will drift and the tweak will silently
no-op (or, worst case, crash on a method whose signature changed). **Don't
install this dylib against a KIOU version other than the one above without
re-deriving every RVA first.**

## Requirements

- [Theos](https://theos.dev/) with the standard iOS toolchain installed
  (`$THEOS` set). Kiou Kif Exporter is pure Objective-C — no Orion, no
  Swift runtime.
- iOS 15.0–16.5, arm64, rootless layout.
- For the jailed (sideload) path: a decrypted copy of the KIOU `.ipa`.

## Build

### Jailbroken device (rootless)

Produces a `.deb` that installs to
`/var/jb/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/`.

```sh
make package
# install over SSH (password: alpine on first run, then key-based)
make package install THEOS_DEVICE_IP=<device-ip>
```

### Jailed device (sideload)

Produces a bare dylib for injection via Sideloadly / AltStore / Apple
Developer Program. The dylib statically links Dobby so it has zero hook-
engine dependency at install time.

```sh
make jailed
# -> packages/jailed/KiouKifExporter.dylib
```

The `make jailed` target also prints an `otool -L` of the resulting
binary; it must **not** mention `libsubstrate` or `libdobby`.

Sideloadly install:

1. Build with `make jailed`.
2. In Sideloadly, load the decrypted KIOU `.ipa`.
3. Add `packages/jailed/KiouKifExporter.dylib` under **Inject dylib**.
4. Tick **Enable File Sharing** so Files.app picks the sandbox up.
5. Sign with your Apple ID / certificate and install.

## Where the logs go

The dylib writes its own diagnostic log into the KIOU sandbox:

```
<KIOU sandbox>/tmp/kioukifexporter.log
```

— which translates to `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<UUID>/tmp/kioukifexporter.log`
on a jailbroken device. Tail it over SSH to watch matches resolve in
real time:

```sh
ssh root@<device-ip> 'tail -F /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/*/tmp/kioukifexporter.log'
```

Each match produces a tidy run of `[MMODE]` lifecycle lines and a final
`[KIF] wrote <N> bytes -> ...` confirmation.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Scope |
|---|---|
| **v0.1** | All 15 `IMatchMode` hooks installed, KIF pipeline live, file naming, sandbox output. `KIFWriteOptions` shipped all-null. |
| **v0.2** (current) | `BlackPlayerName` / `WhitePlayerName` / `StartDateTime` / `MatchTitle` / `TimeRuleLabel` / `EndingLabel` filled at match end. Player names come from `GameStateStore._<black|white>PlayerInfo` (the same `ReactiveProperty` the on-screen UI reads), with a `MatchConfig` fallback for AI / local / replay modes. |
| **v0.3** | Per-move consumption times via `mach_absolute_time()` accumulation + `List<long>..ctor()` / `Add(long)` to build `KIFWriteOptions.ThinkingTimesMicros` — restores the `(M:SS/HH:MM:SS)` annotation on each move. |
| **v0.4** | Static binary patch distribution: bake the same hook chain into a patched `UnityFramework` so non-jailbroken iOS 18 installs (where the CSM kills inline hooks before the dylib's constructor runs) keep working without Dobby. Tracked alongside the sibling KiouEditor binpatch plan. |

## Sibling tweaks

Kiou Kif Exporter shares its il2cpp helpers and logging plumbing with two
sister projects you can install side-by-side. All three can coexist in the
same KIOU process:

- [**Kiou Editor**](https://github.com/IPA-Patch/KiouEditor) — the
  client-side customization suite (item unlock, premium gating, engine
  tuning, voice unlock, etc).
- [**Kiou Engine Bridge**](https://github.com/IPA-Patch/KiouEngineBridge) —
  bridges KIOU to a USI shogi engine (YaneuraOu and friends) so you can
  drive a desktop-grade analysis engine against the live board straight
  from the device.

### Scope of use

Intended for **authorized penetration testing and personal research**. The
repository ships no proprietary KIOU assets and does not distribute the
IPA — sourcing a decrypted copy of KIOU for the sideload path is the
reader's responsibility. Treat this dylib as a research-grade observation
tool; don't redistribute the resulting `.kif` files in ways the rights
holders would object to.
